In the process of another test I deleted all the entries in my system
(using the web-interface). Just checking the tables, which should all be empty,
I found that the Custom Fields are still there.
So the remove function should include custom fields, which is currently probably not the case.

Member accounts.
The add / delete functions work perfectly.
One minor issue - the data entered into the 'description' and 'amount' fields
(when adding new transaction) are not removed when the transaction is displayed below.
In fact if I go straight to any other member's account, this data is visible in the
two fields until I leave the circulation "environment" - identical to the problem of
deleting a single transaction
The added transaction remains displayed with the correct member (as it should).

Certainly 'in, out, hold' should not be allowed as choices or all control goes bad.
The other book maintenance related values make sense as there is no other way to take book

18 May 2013 - Neil, working now! - 19 May 2013
a publisher search in existing items produces a lot of error text (see attached image, publisher error)
a publisher search in Report | Item search - works reasonably well.

When editing an existing item, Fetch On-line data is not working.
Also it should use LCCN, ISSN, Title (in that order) if ISBN is not available

Whilst I was searching through files, I noticed that in classes/report.php  -  
line34: refers to /shared/biblio_search.php file
Is  this correct - I can not find this file at that location but it is in 
the /reports/defs/ subdirectory

02 May 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixed 8 May 2013 (see end of BiblioRows.php)
The displayed results of Item Serach only shows the entry in fields 245a & 245b,
Would it be possible to show the entry in either field 245a,b or 240a 
(as with the existing items search results) and make which ever is displayed linked to the item?
If it is not possible to have a link created to one of two possible fields, 
would it be better to add a row number of the barcode that would be a fixed field 
to which the link can be created?

07 May 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixd 8 May 2013
I just started adding new items tomy newly created OB dbase but I have got a major problem.
When I select manual entry the fields shown are those for the default media type. 
If I select another from the drop down menu - there is no change.
I have the same results when I use your OB data as well as using a fresh install of  OB (changeset 630)
On a couple of occasions OB would not launch - blank loginform.php page: firebug 
came up with 'no-js no-obinstall' as the reason for not being able to open OB 
(this was even with a fresh OB install)

07 May 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixed 7 May 2013
Bulk Delete: on clicking on the menu item, I just get the title "Bulk Delete Items" and no box.

03 May 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixed 3 May 2013
I have noticed that the 'Exact Match' option works for - 
Call No., keyword; author, title, subject, date, Publisher
It does not work for either collection or media-type, Barcode.
For example, if I type 'taxon' (instead of taxonomy) for collection, 
I get no results regardless of whether Exact Match 'No' or 'Yes' is selected. 
If the full name is entered, I get results with either 'No' or 'Yes' (as you would expect)
I have not tested it with Address, Grade Level

02 May 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixed 3 May 2013
Looking at both lists through the admin menu - media-type has the numeric code listed 
(so, easy to refer to).
Collections list does not have such a list

29 Apr 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixed 3 May 2013
When I open the edit existing item box for the most recently added item, 
the correct collection option (in the drop down menu) is not displayed 
- it is the very first collection item in the drop down list that is displayed 
(see image, edit existing item - should read ecology not archaeology), 
even though the correct collection name was entered originally.
However, with the remaining items the collection displayed is correct.

01 May 2013 - Fred - done 2 May 2013
standalone tools for translation maintenance need to be added to Tools menu.

- Fred - done 30 Apr 2013
Tools, need ability to set colation/charset of ALL tables

29 Apr 2013 - Neil Redgate - now text will be displayed on multiple lines as needed, 29 Apr 2013
Following on from the increased field size for long titles, 
I have a problem with the display of these items. (see attached image)
An item with <125 characters in the title is displayed correctly.
An item with 146 characters in the title is not - 
all the MARC field info is displaced below the 'more info' button.

- Fred - fixed 28 Apr 2013
trans.php function T() no longer alows variable insertion (%xxx%)

28 Apr 2013 - Neil Redgate - increased limit to 256, 28 Apr 2013
The title & subtitle fields only allow 75 characters.
Can I change its size (from within OB or myPHP admin) or is this something that 
you have to amend within the programme to ensure full synchronicity?
Would this be a useful edit option to have for each filed listed in the 
biblio fields Maintenance page -so users can adjust their dbase according to their needs?
(Something in the back of my mind is saying that I may have asked about this very early on and,
I apologise, I cannot remember what your comment was - 
as to whether there is a physical limit from mysql/OB 
or it was something to be looked at a later date?)

7 Apr 2013 - Neil Redgate - fixed, 27 Apr 2013
>  As a result of the above, I reworked my biblio fields for my book type.
> I noticed that some of the tags are not "draggable" to the layout column, 
even though they are listed in the field/tag column.
> For example, 260g (Date of Manufacture) 
(I was looking at this option as a reprint date, when I was investigating the above)
> This is not a problem for me at the moment 
(all fields required have been dragged to the layout column)
