## üìù Analytics

### üìù Analytics - Monthly Circulation Report 

![Homepage](./readme_assets/monthly_circ.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

The **Monthly Circulation Report** is a dynamic analytics feature in BurauenBiblio that visualizes the **total number of items borrowed per month**, across a selected range of time. It helps library staff and administrators: üìÖ **Track Borrowing Trends** üìö **Evaluate Usage Patterns** üéØ **Support Decision-Making** based on actual demand.

### üìù Analytics - Top 30 Dewey Decimal Stats

![Homepage](./readme_assets/deweydecimalchart.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

The **Top 30 DDC Stats** feature provides an analysis of the library‚Äôs collection by visualizing the **number of copies per Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) category**. A utility is included which allows creation of DDC table needed to make a graph (Number of Copies VS. DDC code).  The DDC utility requires a certain amount of catalogued books using DDC to get a meaningful chart.

Added 'Export to JSON' feature viewing data into JSON format for other value adding services i.e. e-bulletin.

### üìù Advanced Dewey Decimal Classification Mapping

![Homepage](./readme_assets/ddcmappingtable.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

This process enriches bibliographic records by interpreting **Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) numbers** into **human-readable subject categories**.

Using a **reference dataset**, we translate **raw numerical codes** into three levels of categorization: **Main Class, Division Class and Topic Class**.

Both **DDC Stats** and **DDC table listing** helps:
- Identify which classes/discipline dominate the collection.
- Spot underrepresented categories where more resources may be needed.
- Make data-informed decision for future acquisitions, inventory reviews and budget planning.
- Demonstrate the diversity of holdings to stakeholders, management, or partner institutions.
- Saves time compared to manual catalog analysis.

> DDC category descriptions are adapted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes) under the [CC BY-SA 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

### üìù Analytics - Top 30 Borrowed Books and Top 30 Most-viewed books

![Homepage](./readme_assets/sample_viewed.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

The **Top 30 Borrowed Books list** showcases the titles most frequently borrowed over the past six months.

The **Top 30 Most-Viewed Books** tracks books that are regularly read or referenced by patrons within the library but not officially borrowed. This in-house usage is measured over a one-month activity span.

Before reshelving, staff can use the dedicated **In-House Book Activity Tracker** form:

![Homepage](./readme_assets/dailytally3.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

By scanning each book‚Äôs barcode‚Äîeither using a barcode scanner or manual input‚Äîthe system **automatically records book activity** and provides an option to **view the most recently scanned items**. This feature helps reduce reliance on paper-based tallies and ensures more accurate records. In addition, daily book tallies are **visualized through an interactive graph** with an integrated **JSON export** option for reporting and data analysis.

These analytics provide valuable insights into **reading trends**, **student preferences**, and **subject demand**. They support **data-driven collection development** while helping libraries move toward a **paperless, more efficient workflow**.

### üìù Analytics - Library Attendance Tracking

![Homepage](./readme_assets/attendance_tracking.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

A logging system designed for statistical reporting and community interaction insights. The feature allows encoding of monthly visits categorized by user type (Student, Faculty, Visitor) and, when applicable, by academic program. Using dynamic visualizations powered by Chart.js, library staff can instantly view attendance trends across custom date ranges.

![Homepage](./readme_assets/export_json.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

### üßπ Utility - Database Migration Manager

![Homepage](./readme_assets/migrate_tool1.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

If you wish to try out Burauenbiblio to your existing Openbiblio database, you may use this tool to make your db compatible. This utility allows the database structure to evolve safely as new features are introduced ‚Äî without breaking the existing database. 

> Note: Please make a backup of your existing database and also have a copy of your dbParams.php (Use your original dbParams.php and overwrite the existing file)

This tool: 
- Safely applies new schema updates
- Skips previously executed migrations
- Enables smooth upgrades as BurauenBiblio evolves
- Tested on old Openbiblio 1.0 db
- Updates all Openbiblio table engine to InnoDB

## üôå Project Direction

![Homepage](./readme_assets/actual_use_case.webp "BurauenBiblio Homepage")

This project is part of my ongoing personal initiative to modernize the OpenBiblio codebase.

The development focuses on:

- Fixing critical bugs

- Enhancing the user interface

- Introducing new features to improve usability and performance

Recent updates also incorporate **HTMX** and other modern frontend tools, delivering a more dynamic and responsive user experience‚Äîwithout the overhead of a full JavaScript framework. This approach keeps the system lightweight, accessible, and well-suited for **small libraries and schools** while aligning with current **web standards**.

On the backend, parts of the **legacy procedural PHP code** have been refactored into a more **object-oriented (class-based)** structure, improving maintainability, reusability, and overall code clarity.

This modernization effort builds on the original **OpenBiblio system**, tailored to the needs of libraries in the **Philippines**, with a strong focus on **performance, compatibility, and ease of use**.

If you find this project valuable, you can support its development so it can continue to grow and serve libraries effectively.
