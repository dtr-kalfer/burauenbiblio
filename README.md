# BurauenBiblio 📚🌴

## Project Credit & Intent

BurauenBiblio is a derivative work of the original OpenBiblio system, tailored for modern PHP8.0 environments and localized school library needs in the Philippines.
Maintained as a community-driven, open-source initiative to revitalize and extend OpenBiblio's functionality designed to aid small libraries and schools.
It is named in honor of my hometown in Leyte, Burauen.

This repository includes a small set of sample bibliographic records (books) and fictional member accounts as part of the included SQL data.
These are provided solely for the purpose of demonstrating and testing the functionality of the OpenBiblio system.

The book entries are either fictional or based on public domain sources, and any associated thumbnail images are used under public domain or fair use for educational/demo purposes.

The member records are entirely fictitious and do not represent real individuals.

## ✅ PHP 8.0 Migration Notes

![Homepage](./readme_assets/actual_use_case_2.webp "OpenBiblio Homepage")

The system is currently in active use, handling bibliographic search requests from both students and faculty. It manages a collection of nearly 5,000 bibliographic records. Migrating the application from PHP 5.7 to PHP 8.0 has resulted in notable performance gains, particularly in search responsiveness and overall system speed—all while running on the same legacy hardware.

> **This upgrade is part of my ongoing personal initiative to modernize the OpenBiblio codebase while maintaining backward compatibility.** The project is now in its final stages, focusing on critical bug fixes, user interface enhancements, and full support for PHP 8.0. Further improvements—especially in UI/UX—are being developed, with planned integrations using more modern programming approaches and frontend technologies. --F. Tumulak
